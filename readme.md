# 3rd-Conditional
This project calculates the compound interest of staking coins.

Let's say you are getting rewards for your staking in crypto currency, and you want to calculate how many coins you will make.
For example you have 1 SOL and you get staking rewards per week, and you decide to reinvest your rewards into staking, how much SOL will you have in a week? month? year?
10 years?

This is the caluclator for you!

The compound interest formula is as follows:

#a = p*(1 + (r/n))**(n,t)

# A = the future value of the investment/loan, including interest
# P = the principal investment amount (the initial deposit or loan amount)
# r = the annual interest rate (decimal)
# n = the number of times that interest is compounded per unit t
# t = the time the money is invested or borrowed for
# [staked_interest = returns_per_week(1 + (interest_rate/number_of_times_per_week))**(number_of_times_per_week/t) )]
# If an amount of $5,000 is deposited into a savings account at an annual interest rate of 5%,
# compounded monthly, the value of the investment after 10 years can be calculated as follows...
#P = 5000.
# r = 5/100 = 0.05 (decimal).
#n = 12.
#t = 10.
# If we plug those figures into the formula, we get the following:
# A = 5000 (1 + 0.05 / 12) (12 * 10) = 8235.05.
# So, the investment balance after 10 years is $8,235.05
